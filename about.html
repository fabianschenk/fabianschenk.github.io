## About

I'm currently a PhD research assistant at the <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/institutes/icg/home/">Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG)</a> at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/">Graz University of Technology</a>.
My research interests are primarily in the field of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and visual odometry (VO) with special focus on real-time application.
I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Graz University of Technology and 
also spent one year at the University Carlos III in Madrid, Spain.
 <!-- in 2012 and his MSc degree in 2014.
Fabian Schenk received his BSc Degree in Biomedical Engineering at Graz University of Technology in 2012 and his MSc degree in 2014. 
During his Master's study he spent one year at the University Carlos III in Madrid, Spain. He is currently doing his PhD as a research assistant at the Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG) at Graz University of Technology. 
Even though he initially started his PhD research in the field of semantic segmentation from aerial images, he later moved to robust real-time RGB-D SLAM and dense 3D reconstruction. Since February 2016 he is working on the KIRAS project “CSI SmartScan 3D” in cooperation with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute Graz (LBI) and Holistic Imaging. The goal of this work is to improve crime scene investigation and documentation with 3D models generated from robust reconstruction and tracking algorithms from data recorded by modern multi-sensor systems (RGB-D, IMU,...). His research interests are in the field of multi-sensor fusion, RGB-D image data, 3D reconstruction, tracking and SLAM systems.
asdfsadf Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>. -->

Octocat is Github's logo and trademark and here is used to illustrate a fictional character (John Smith) that used the *{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme to build his website.
