This year I have the great honour to be one of the workshop chairs for the Computer Vision Winter Workshop (CVWW) 2019.
The CVWW is the annual meeting of several computer vision research groups located in Graz, Ljubljana, Prague, and Vienna. 
The main goal of this workshop is to communicate fresh scientific ideas within these four groups and to provide conference experience to PhD students. However, the workshop is open to everyone.
Submission is already over but you can still join as a visitor.
