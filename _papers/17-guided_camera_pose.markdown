In this paper, we present an idea for a sparse approach to calculate camera poses from RGB images
and laser distance measurements to perform subsequent facade reconstruction. The core idea is
to guide the image recording process by choosing distinctive features with the laser range finder,
e.g. building or window corners. From these distinctive features, we can establish correspondences
between views to compute metrically accurate camera poses from just a few precise measurements. In
our experiments, we achieve reasonable results in building facade reconstruction with only a fraction
of features compared to standard structure from motion.
